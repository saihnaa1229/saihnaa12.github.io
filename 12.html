	<div>An ocean (or sea) is the body of salt water which covers approximately 71% of the surface of the Earth.[1] It is also "any of the large bodies of water into which the great ocean is divided".[1] These five oceans are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans.[2][3]

Saline seawater covers approximately 361,000,000 km2 (139,000,000 sq mi) and is customarily divided into several principal oceans and smaller seas, with the ocean as a whole covering approximately 71% of Earth's surface and 90% of the Earth's biosphere.[4] The oceans contains 97% of Earth's water, and oceanographers have stated that less than 20% of the oceans have been mapped.[4] The total volume is approximately 1.35 billion cubic kilometers (320 million cu mi) with an average depth of nearly 3,700 meters (12,100 ft).[5][6][7]
